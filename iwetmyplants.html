          Our web app makes it easy for individuals or businesses to manage their plant care needs. Developed by a team of five over three months using Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL, the project was implemented with SCRUM principles for effective collaboration. My responsibilities included the design management, project write ups, personas, user stories, storyboards, UML diagram, activity and sequence diagrams, crafting database schema, conducting acceptance tests, coding HTML/CSS pages, making demo videos and delivering presentations.

        <h2>Milestone 1: Project Ideation</h2>
        <p>
          In this milestone, we brainstormed and evaluated various project ideas that aligned with our interests and goals, aiming to identify feasible concepts to pursue within the given timeline. Through collaboration and idea-sharing, we compiled a list of potential projects, assessing their viability and narrowing them down to the most promising one.

        <h2>Milestone 2: Project Definition and Planning</h2>
        <p>
          In this milestone, we facilitated a collaborative effort among team members to produce a detailed project and product documents, ensuring alignment with business objectives and strategic priorities.
        </p>
        <h3>Product Description</h3>
        <p>
          Our project is a houseplant management system, which will help users schedule plant watering and other types of care. This application will allow profile pages for each plant, which will include a variety of data, such as photos of the plant (uploaded by the user), its name, watering schedule, soil type, humidity requirements, sunlight requirements, and other details desired by the user. This application will also include a database with basic information on common plant species and their general types of care, so that users can easily fill in each plant's information, then customize as needed. Since this will be a web application, the user can access it via their desktop or mobile device to upload photos and other information. Each user’s account will send updates to the user via text or email (their preference). It would also be possible to send updates to an outside user, such as a house-sitter, who would be caring for the plants.
        </p>
        <h3>Need and Value</h3>
        <p>
          Many people find it difficult to remember to water their plants in a timely manner, due to their busy lifestyles. With the occurrence of Covid-19, houseplants have become a booming industry, as many people are spending more time at home. Plant owners have anywhere from a few to hundreds of plants, based on their interest level. Even after the pandemic concludes, many new people will have gained a love of houseplants and will benefit from a plant management system. Users would save time by knowing exactly which plants need their attention and also reduce the amount of money lost on neglected plants.
        </p>
        <h3>Stakeholders</h3>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Seasoned houseplant lovers seeking organization</li>
            <li>New houseplant enthusiasts, who need help figuring out how often to water certain types of plants</li>
            <li>House-sitters, who care for plants while their owners are away</li>
            <li>Team Omicron, as administrators, updating the quality and functionality of the app</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Technology Requirements</h3>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Standard languages for creating a locally-hosted web application:</li>
            <ul>

        <h2>Milestone 3: User-Centered Design</h2>
        <p>
          In this milestone, we conducted research on our target audience's needs and behaviors to craft personas and epics, create comprehensive user stories and acceptance tests, design a robust database schema and UML diagram, and establish story points and a product backlog. This work provided a strong foundation for a successful product development process while assuring that we met the needs of our target audience.

        <h2>What I Learned</h2> 
        <p>
          Participating in the "I Wet My Plants" project provided me with a wealth of knowledge and skills in various domains, including user-centered design, project management, web development, collaboration, time management, and communication. By adopting a user-focused approach, I refined my techniques in creating personas, crafting user stories, and designing intuitive UX interfaces. Furthermore, I gained a deep understanding of Agile methodologies, specifically Scrum, and its associated practices, such as sprint planning and retrospectives. Additionally, I acquired practical experience in full-stack web development, utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python to build a fully operational web application.
