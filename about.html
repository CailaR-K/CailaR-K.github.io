        <h2>My Goal</h2>
        <p class="about-text">
          My goal is to create intuitive and engaging experiences for users. I excel at taking complex tasks and distilling them down to their core components,making them both more accessible and efficient for end-users. My expertise 
          spans multiple design applications and programming languages, allowing me to adapt quickly to new environments and requirements. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I am currently searching for exciting opportunities in the design and technology fields, preferably located in Saskatoon, although I am open to remote positions as well. Ultimately, I strive to work on projects that positively impact our world through technology.

        <h2>More About Me</h2>
        <p class="about-text">
          I am a User Experience Designer, Product Designer and Software Developer driven by a passion for problem-solving and a deep appreciation for beauty in all things. Travel has always been one of my greatest sources of inspiration, which led me to explore New Zealand and Australia for two exhilarating years. Since then, I have had the opportunity to explore different countries such as Japan, China, Costa Rica, and Mexico. Through these cultural experiences, I developed a keen eye for detail and an ability to understand people from various walks of life. As a result, my empathy towards human behaviour guides my design process towards solutions that truly resonate with users. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of work, I channel my creative energy into photography, animation, printmaking and fabric dyeing. Itâ€™s relaxing to work with these mediums after long hours behind the computer screen and they allow me to think outside the box when crafting unique and compelling interfaces for the end user.  Lastly, hiking, playing soccer, or simply getting my hands 
          dirty gardening help me clear my mind and rejuvenate my spirits so that I can face another day full of challenges head-on. All in all, I believe design is a reflection of our own personality and values, therefore my 
          goal is to create meaningful interactions that leave a lasting impact for people.
